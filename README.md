## Exercise Solutions.
Discussions and links to code for various exercises from the book Head First Java.

### Chapter 1 - A Quick Dip.

#### Page 9 - Writing a class with main.
Typing, compiling and running of a program called [MyFirstAppJava](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/MyFirstAppJava/src/MyFirstApp.java). The output of this program will be:  
```
I Rule!
The World is yours!
```
#### Page 12 - Example of a while loop.
Typing, compiling and running of a program called [Loopy](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/Loopy/src/Loopy.java). The output of this program will be:  
```
Before the Loop
In the Loop
Value of x is 1
In the Loop
Value of x is 2
In the Loop
Value of x is 3
This is after the loop
```
#### Page 14 - Example of a while loop of the Beer Song.
Typing, compiling and running of a program called [BeerSong](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/BeerSong/src/BeerSong.java). This is the song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FITjBet3dio). I recommend just listening the song and not drinking the 99 beers ... alone.

#### Page 24 - Example of a while loop.
Typing, compiling and running of a program called [PoolPuzzleOne](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/PoolPuzzleOne/src/PoolPuzzleOne.java). The output of this program will be:
```
a noise 
annoys 
an oyster 
```
### Chapter 2 - Classes and Objects.

#### Page 38 - The Guessing Game.
The guessing game involves a `game` object and three `player` objects. The game generates a random number between 0 and 9, and the three player objects try to guess it. You can found the project [here](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/tree/master/GuessGame/src)

Classes:

[GuessGame.java] (https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/GuessGame/src/GuessGame.java)

[Player.java] (https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/GuessGame/src/Player.java)

[GameLauncher.java] (https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/GuessGame/src/GameLauncher.java)

#### Page 42 - Be the Compiler.
The code about tape decks will not compile because an object, called t, is used without being created. A fixed version of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/TapeDeck/src/TapeDeck.java). The output of this program will be:  
```
tape playing
tape recording
```

The code about DVD players will not compile because an method is called that isn't defined in the class DVDPlayer. A fixed version of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/SantiagoH3/Java-Projects/blob/master/DVDPlayer/src/DVDPlayerTestDrive.java). The output of this program will be:  
```
DVD playing
DVD recording
```
